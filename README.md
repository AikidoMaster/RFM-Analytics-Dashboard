# RFM Analysis for Customer Segmentation

## Overview

This repository contains a detailed implementation of RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis for customer segmentation. RFM Analysis is a powerful technique in marketing that helps businesses understand their customers based on their purchasing behavior, leading to more effective targeting and customer retention strategies.

## Features

- **Data Preparation:** Clean and preprocess the customer transaction data.
- **RFM Calculation:** Compute Recency, Frequency, and Monetary scores for each customer.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Segment customers into categories like 'Champions', 'Potential Loyalists', and 'At Risk Customers' based on their RFM scores.
- **Visualization:** Generate insightful visualizations, including bar charts, treemaps, and heatmaps, to better understand the customer segments.
