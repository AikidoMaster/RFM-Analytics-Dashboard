# RFM Analysis for Customer Segmentation

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis for customer segmentation, accompanied by an interactive dashboard built using Dash. RFM Analysis is a powerful tool in marketing that helps businesses categorize customers based on their purchasing behavior, enabling more personalized marketing strategies and improved customer retention.

## Features

- **Data Preparation:** Clean and preprocess customer transaction data.
- **RFM Calculation:** Compute Recency, Frequency, and Monetary scores for each customer.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Segment customers into meaningful categories such as 'Champions', 'Potential Loyalists', and 'At Risk Customers' based on their RFM scores.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Visualize and interact with the customer segments through an easy-to-use Dash app, allowing dynamic exploration of different charts and analyses.
- **Visualization:** Generate and display various charts, including bar charts, treemaps, and heatmaps, to gain insights into customer behavior.

## Dashboard

The interactive dashboard allows you to dynamically select and view various charts related to the RFM analysis:

- **RFM Value Segment Distribution:** Visualizes the distribution of customers across different value segments.
- **Distribution of RFM Values within Customer Segment:** Displays a treemap of customer segments within each RFM value segment.
- **Correlation Matrix of RFM Values within Champions Segment:** Shows the correlation between Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values within the 'Champions' segment.
- **Comparison of RFM Segments:** Compares the number of customers in each RFM segment.
- **Comparison of RFM Segments based on Scores:** Compares the average Recency, Frequency, and Monetary scores across different customer segments.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install pandas plotly dash
```

### Running the Analysis and Dashboard

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/rfm-analysis-dashboard.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd rfm-analysis-dashboard
    ```

3. Run the Python script to start the Dash app:

    ```bash
